//! @specforge/product — the product planning vocabulary and its queries.
//!
//! The vocabulary (kinds, edges, shared fields, rules) is declared with the
//! SDK builders in [`declaration`]; the handshake is derived by the SDK from
//! the extension metadata and the contributions.
//! The CLI commands (`specforge product <command>`, auto-promoted to the MCP
//! tools `specforge.product.<id>`) are declared with their handlers in
//! [`commands`], over the queries in [`queries`]: the SDK derives their
//! `surfaces` payload and routes their `cmd__product_*` exports.
