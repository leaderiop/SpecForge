//! The `specforge product <command>` commands, each declared ([`declare`])
//! with the handler that answers its `cmd__product_<id>` export: the SDK
//! derives the `surfaces` payload and the export routing from the one
//! declaration. A handler reads its args through the declaration
//! ([`CommandCall`]), runs a query over the graph the host passes and
//! renders it in the format the host asked for (`human`, the CLI default,
//! or `json`, always over MCP; ADR 0011). The same exports serve the MCP
//! tools `specforge.product.<id>`.
//!
//! Under `json` a command prints one object, the payload type its surface
//! behavior names; under `human` its layout here, a table with a header row
//! where the payload is tabular. A command that cannot answer prints one
//! `ProductSurfaceError` to stderr and nothing to stdout: `ENTITY_NOT_FOUND`
//! (exit 1) with the nearest id of the kind, or `INVALID_INPUT` (exit 2).
