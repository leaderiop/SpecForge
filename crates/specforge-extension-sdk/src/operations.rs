//! Operational contributions declared with their handlers: compiler
//! passes, collectors, custom rules, scanners and the migration hook.
//!
//! As for surfaces (ADR 0011), one declaration gives both halves: the
//! descriptor the host loads and the routing of the export the host then
//! calls (`__pass_<name>`, `collect__<name>`, the rule's `wasm_function`,
//! the analyzer's `scan_export`, the hook's name) to the handler, which
//! reads the protocol's input type and answers its answer type (ADR 0013).
//! A declaration cannot lack its code: declaring one without its handler
//! panics when the extension is built.
//!
//! Each handler is wrapped, where it is declared, in the code that decodes
//! its input and encodes its answer, so a guest links the wire code of the
//! operations it declares and no other.
