//! The compiled project (architecture plan 01, ADR 0004 D1-d).
//!
//! Every surface (`specforge check` and the other CLI commands, watch, the
//! LSP, MCP) used to assemble "config, extensions, registries, resolve,
//! graph, checks" on its own, and each copy drifted. This crate owns that
//! assembly:
//! - an [`Environment`] is everything derived from `specforge.json` and the
//!   loaded extensions before any `.spec` file is read;
//! - a [`CompiledProject`] is an environment plus the sources read in it,
//!   their graph build and what the imports and the checks reported. Its
//!   [`CompiledProject::diagnostics`] are, by definition, what `specforge
//!   check` reports, in the one report order;
//! - a [`ProjectSession`] is a compiled project kept current
//!   ([`ProjectSession::project`]) plus what it is built from: its inputs
//!   ([`SessionInputs`]) say what a changed path is ([`InputRole`]), and it
//!   applies changes as an update, an environment reload or a re-check
//!   (watch, the LSP and MCP each hold one). After every update that runs
//!   the checks it reports what a fresh compile reports, in the same order.
