//! One registry build: the loaded declarations in, everything the
//! compiler derives from them out (ADR 0012).
//!
//! [`build_registries`] owns the order: it puts the declarations in load
//! order (ADR 0041), checks them (identity and shape, consistency, peers,
//! pass order), then populates the registries, builds the rule set (the declared rules,
//! checked and resolved, plus the host's E006 rules; ADR 0020) and
//! registers the surfaces. Callers read [`RegistryBuild`].
//! It is pure: no I/O, no runtime.
