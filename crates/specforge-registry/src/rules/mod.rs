//! The validation rules a project's extensions declare, plus the host's E006
//! rules for required fields, as one typed set that runs itself (ADR 0020).
//!
//! [`Rules::build`] turns each declared descriptor into a [`Rule`] whose
//! check carries exactly what that check reads, resolved once against the
//! registries: a `matches` regex compiled, an edge rule's peer kind, the
//! graph field labels a cycle rule's edge type is written as. A descriptor
//! that cannot work as declared is W112 and is not registered. [`Rules::check`]
//! runs every rule over a [`RuleInput`] (the entity snapshot's records, its
//! edges and the spec root, ADR 0019), in a fixed order, asking
//! [`CustomVerdicts`] for `custom` rules. Rules read field text
//! (`EntityRecord::field`/`writes`), never stringify a value. Nothing
//! outside this module reads a rule's parts.
