//! Every builtin declares only codes it owns, at the level the catalog gives
//! them. The builtins write their rule codes as text and do not link the
//! catalog (a guest that did would be rebuilt on every explanation edit,
//! ADR 0026 D4); the registry build checks each rule when it registers it
//! (`check_extension_code`, W150), and this test checks them all, so a
//! mismatch fails a test and not only a user's compile.
