//! The LSP's one reaction to a change the client reports (ADR 0035 D6, ADR 0043): apply it to
//! the project session, publish what the project reports, then, when what the session is built
//! from moved, ask the editor to watch it and catch up on what changed on disk while it did not,
//! and last tell the editor its highlighting may be stale. Opening the workspace and closing a
//! document are reactions too. Everything is told to the editor through the [`Editor`] port.
//!
//! The reaction is synchronous (ADR 0043, amending ADR 0023 D8): it reads files and runs the
//! checks, so it runs on the blocking pool, one change at a time. It takes the state's lock
//! only briefly, with the blocking accessors, and never holds it while it talks to the editor;
//! readers meanwhile see the session's last complete graph (`LspState`'s stand-in). It must not
//! be called from an async task.
