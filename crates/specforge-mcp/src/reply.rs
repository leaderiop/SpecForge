//! A core tool's reply: one typed definition per tool (ADR 0048).
//!
//! A handler answers its module's `Reply` (a struct, or an untagged union
//! of structs, deriving `Serialize` and `Shape`), or [`Text`] for a tool
//! whose result is a document in text. The tool table names the type once
//! (`view!(stats::call, NoArgs => stats::Reply, ProjectTarget::SERVED)`):
//! the listed outputSchema is `<Reply as Shape>::schema()`, the result is
//! the value serialized, and [`conforming`] checks every structured result
//! against that schema before it is sent: a reply its schema refuses is a
//! `schema_mismatch` failure, never structured content (the rule extension
//! tools follow).
