//! One MCP request that invokes something by name — `tools/call`,
//! `resources/read`, `prompts/get` — through one pipeline (ADR 0024): read
//! the request, find what it names (the core table, then, with the served
//! project brought up to date, the extension surface table), record the
//! invocation, resolve the call target, run the handler, record what it
//! reported, and answer with the kind's envelope. Each request kind is one
//! [`Surface`] adapter; no other code builds the reply of these three
//! methods; it also owns the one freshness decision of the extension
//! surface table (a lookup, a listing, a subscription). The router guards
//! initialization.
