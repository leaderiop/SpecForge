//! What a mutation tool wrote, and the one place that acts on it (ADR 0022).
//!
//! A mutation handler returns [`Replied`]: its reply and, unless it only
//! previewed, a [`Written`] built from its operation's typed outcome. The
//! tools adapter of the request pipeline then calls [`refresh`] (inside the
//! call, while it holds the target) and [`report`]: nothing else in the
//! crate brings a target up to date after a write, names a mutation's
//! events or tells the client which files the call wrote.
//!
//! A mutation handler (format, rename, init, add_extension,
//! remove_extension, migrate) performs its real function against the same
//! library backends the CLI uses (canned placeholder responses are
//! forbidden: a tool either does real work or refuses with an explicit
//! error). It returns its reply and what its operation wrote, typed: the
//! files from the operation's [`specforge_ops::Writes`], the entities it
//! changed and its domain event; a preview says it only previewed. It never
//! refreshes the target or records an event itself: this module does.
