//! The project view: what every operation over a compiled project reads
//! (CONTEXT.md "Project view", ADR 0015).
//!
//! A surface builds one from the project it holds, however it holds it (a
//! [`CompiledProject`] in the CLI, a [`ProjectSession`] in MCP and the LSP)
//! and hands it to an operation; the operation returns a typed outcome the
//! surface only renders. The view borrows the environment the project was
//! compiled in and says what its surface reports for the project. It owns
//! the project's recorded test report and the coverage computed from it,
//! both read at the root the project was compiled from and never in an
//! ancestor directory.
