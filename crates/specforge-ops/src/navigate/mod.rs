//! Navigating a project: where an entity is declared, what references it,
//! which entities match a text, which entities a diagnostic is about, and
//! the edits that fix a diagnostic. The LSP and MCP answer from here; they
//! convert spans (UTF-16 ranges, JSON) and nothing else. Positions are
//! `SourceSpan`s: 1-based lines, 1-based byte columns, end exclusive.
//!
//! A reference is an occurrence of an entity's ID in another entity's
//! field that resolves to it: one edge of the graph, written where its
//! token is. The references *to* an entity are incoming; what it *refers
//! to* are its outgoing references. Navigation names no kind: kinds,
//! fields and their targets come from the registries (ADR 0016).
