//! Extension commands: the CLI commands extensions declare in their
//! surfaces, each a `cmd__<id>` Wasm export.
//!
//! [`ExtensionCommand`] derives one command, once, for every surface: its
//! name on the command line (`specforge <short> <cli name>`), its MCP tool
//! (`specforge.<short>.<id>`, its input schema), its args' command-line
//! shapes, the args both surfaces send its export (normalized by the one
//! arg rule the SDK also runs, `specforge_protocol_types::command_args`),
//! and why the host refuses it. [`ExtensionCommands`] is the project's
//! routing table. The CLI and MCP both read them and run the command here:
//! the export receives the protocol's `CommandInput` (the args, the project
//! root, the compiled graph in the graph export's shape, the format the
//! caller asked for and the host's date) and answers with a
//! `CommandOutput` (`specforge_protocol_types`, through
//! `specforge_wasm::ExtensionCalls`). The host knows no command: which
//! exist, their args and what they print are the extension's (ADR 0008).
//! The host owns `--format` (ADR 0011), and normalizes the args (ADR 0017).
//! [`run`] runs a command over a project view: it normalizes the given args,
//! sends the project root (absolute, canonical), the evidence of the
//! recorded test report and today's date, and calls the export (ADR 0011,
//! "One operation runs a command").
