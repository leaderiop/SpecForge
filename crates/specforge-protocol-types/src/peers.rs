//! Peer requirements (ADR 0041): what the peers an extension declares mean, decided once.
//!
//! A declared peer (`PeerDependency`, the wire's text) is read as a [`PeerRequirement`]: the peer's
//! name, a SemVer range read as Cargo reads one, and whether the peer may be absent. [`verdict`] is
//! the one rule saying whether a peer is satisfied by the version its peer is installed at; a set
//! of extensions has one load order and its cycles among required peers ([`Peers`]).
//!
//! Pure: no I/O and no diagnostics. The registry build orders the declarations by it and reports
//! its verdicts (E073, E027, `specforge_common::peers`); `add` and `update` gate on [`verdict`].
