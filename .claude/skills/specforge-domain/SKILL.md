# Specforge Domain

SpecForge is a domain-free engine. It turns what an organisation knows -- its things, how they relate, and the rules
they must obey -- into one typed, validated graph that people and AI agents read and change through standard
protocols. Software specification is one of its biggest use cases, not its definition.

## The five parts

| Part | What it is | Plain words |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **Extensions** | WASM packages that declare entity kinds, fields, edges, validation rules and commands | the "apps": they teach SpecForge a domain |
| **The graph** | every entity and link, compiled from `.spec` files | the "memory", the single source of truth |
| **Validation** | the extensions' rules plus structural checks, on every compile and every edit | the "referee": a change that breaks a rule is refused, whoever made it |
| **Surfaces** | CLI, MCP, LSP (with the VS Code extension) and the package registry today; AG-UI and HTTP planned | the "doors" |
| **AI models** | Claude or any agent, driving SpecForge from outside, mostly over MCP | the "brain": bring your own |

## The core knows five keywords

The grammar has five structural keywords: `spec` (the root entity), `ref` (a typed link outside the graph), `use` (an
import), `define` (reserved, registers nothing: W143) and `defaults` (file-level field defaults). Everything else --
`behavior`, `persona`, `invariant`, a GSD `phase`, a pharma `procedure` -- exists only because a loaded extension
declares it. A project's kinds depend only on the `extensions` list in `specforge.json`; with none, SpecForge runs in
structural-only mode (I002).

So the first question about any project is "which extensions does it load?" -- `specforge extensions`,
`specforge schema`, `specforge infer-guide` (MCP: `specforge.extensions`, `specforge.schema`). Write only the kinds
those declare; for a custom domain, its extension's declarations are the reference.

## The builtin extensions: a starter set

These ship inside the binary as examples of what an extension can declare. They are not the base.

| Extension | Declares |
|-----------|----------|
| `@specforge/software` | kinds `behavior`, `event`, `type`, `port` |
| `@specforge/product` | kinds `feature`, `journey`, `persona`, `channel`, `deliverable`, `milestone`, `module`, `term`, `release`; extension commands (`specforge product features`, ...) |
| `@specforge/governance` | kinds `invariant`, `decision`, `constraint`, `failure_mode` |
| `@specforge/formal` | kinds `property`, `axiom`, `protocol`, `refinement`, `process`; adds `requires`/`ensures`/`maintains`/`abstract`/`refines`/`sync` to behaviors; analysis passes |
| `@specforge/testing` | no kinds: which kinds owe `verify` obligations and with which verify kinds, and the coverage pass |
| `@specforge/cargo-test`, `@specforge/vitest` | test collectors for `specforge collect` |
| `@specforge/rust`, `@specforge/typescript` | source analyzers for `specforge infer-*` |

`specforge model` renders the kinds and relationships the loaded extensions declare; it is the authoritative list.

## Use cases

- **Software specification** -- the builtins above. Spec frameworks can be modelled as extension families: a GSD
  family `@gsd/*` is being designed (its model lives under `gsd/`, nothing built yet); BMAD, OpenSpec and SpecKit
  extensions are not started.
- **Product management and marketing** -- features, personas, channels, journeys, releases, milestones.
- **Regulated industries** -- e.g. pharma/GxP: procedures, decisions, failure modes and an audit trace, with kinds a
  domain extension declares.
- **Any business with entities and rules worth checking.** SpecForge can be the product itself, or the harness a
  business runs on: extensions are its domain, AI models are the brain.

## Shipped vs planned (never blur these)

Shipped: the compiler and validator; the extension SDK and WASM runtime (`specforge extension init|build|validate`);
the builtin extensions; the CLI; the MCP server; the LSP and the VS Code extension; the package registry
(`add`, `search`, `publish`); typed edits (`new`, `set`, `unset`, `link`, `unlink`, `delete`); `collect` (runs the test
runners that extensions declare, after approval); `infer-*` (guides for agents writing specs from existing code).

Planned or in progress -- say so, never imply they work:

- AG-UI and HTTP surfaces, and with them a UI for business users (today they reach SpecForge through an AI agent).
- Live connectors to business systems. WASM extensions are pure (one exported `call`, no imports), and providers
  register ref schemes with no host reader yet: SpecForge does not fetch or sync a CRM, Jira or GitHub.
- The GSD, BMAD, OpenSpec and SpecKit extension families.
- Evidence beyond tests: `verify` and `collect` are test-centred (`unit`, `property`, `integration`, ... as
  `@specforge/testing` declares them). Collecting domain evidence (a signed batch record, an audit) is future work.

## Compiler pipeline

```
.spec files -> Parser -> Resolver -> Graph -> Validation -> Surfaces
               (tree-     (imports,   (nodes,   (structural    (CLI output, MCP tools,
               sitter)    references) edges)    + extension    LSP diagnostics, exports)
                                                rules)
```

1. **Parser** -- a tree-sitter grammar with no domain knowledge: any keyword parses as a generic block.
2. **Resolver** -- binds every reference to an entity across the whole project (`use` is optional) and checks the
   target kind each field declares.
3. **Graph** -- in memory, rebuilt on each compile, incrementally under `specforge watch` and `specforge-lsp`. No database.
4. **Validation** -- structural checks (unknown kind E024, missing required field E006, wrong value E061, unresolved
   reference E003, wrong target kind E022, ...) plus each loaded extension's rules. `specforge explain <code>` explains
   every code (the catalog's anywhere, an extension's own inside the project that loads it); `docs/diagnostics.md`
   lists the catalog's.
5. **Surfaces** -- the same graph behind every door.

## Extension model

An extension is a WASM component built with the Rust SDK (`specforge-extension-sdk`). Its declaration contributes:

- **kinds** with typed fields (string, identifier, enum, reference, reference_list, string_list, date, integer, bool,
  block), required flags, and an inference guide;
- **edges** between kinds, and **enhancements** that add fields to another extension's kind;
- **validation rules** (each with a diagnostic code), **passes** (e.g. formal analysis), **collectors** (test runners)
  and **commands** surfaced as `specforge <extension> <command>` and as MCP tools.

`specforge extension init` scaffolds one, `build` compiles it to `wasm32-wasip2`, `validate` loads it and reports its
declaration's diagnostics. `specforge add` installs from a builtin name, a `.wasm` file or a registry.

## CLI Commands

```bash
specforge init --extensions @specforge/product   # new project (specforge.json + spec/)
specforge add <ext> / remove <ext> / extensions  # manage what the project loads
specforge check [--strict] [--format json]       # parse, resolve, validate
specforge explain <code>                         # a diagnostic code
specforge infer-guide [kind]                     # what each declared kind holds and how to find it in code
specforge schema [--kind K] / model              # the declared kinds, fields and edges
specforge new|set|unset|link|unlink|delete       # typed edits (refuse one that adds errors: E080)
specforge query / trace <id> / explore / review  # read the graph (<id>: a path such as v1.0/03/D-01, or a unique short form)
specforge stats / export / format / migrate
specforge analyze                                # analysis passes declared by extensions (e.g. formal)
specforge collect                                # run declared test runners, record what their tests prove
specforge watch / mcp                            # incremental rebuild; MCP server over stdio
specforge-lsp                                    # the language server: a separate binary (the VS Code extension starts it)
specforge extension init|build|validate          # author an extension
specforge search / publish / login / update      # registry
specforge <extension> <command>                  # an extension's own commands, e.g. specforge product features
```

## What NOT to Do

- Do not call SpecForge "a software specification tool" -- software is one use case of a domain-free engine
- Do not present builtin kinds as "SpecForge's entity types" -- they are what the builtin extensions declare
- Do not write a kind before checking which extensions the project loads
- Do not claim live connectors, AG-UI/HTTP, a business-user UI, or non-test evidence collection exist -- they are planned
- Do not configure in the `spec` block or use `define` -- configuration is `specforge.json`, kinds come from extensions
- Do not assume a database or a server: the graph is in memory and every surface reads the same compile
- Do not hand-write traceability matrices or indexes -- `specforge trace` and `specforge export` generate them
