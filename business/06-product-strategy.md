# SPECFORGE PRODUCT STRATEGY

## 1. Product Vision (3-Year Horizon)

**Vision Statement:** By 2029, SpecForge is the universal structured context standard for AI agents — the specification layer that makes any AI agent perform any task correctly, every time.

**Year 1 (2026): The Compiler.** SpecForge ships as a developer tool that replaces unstructured context files with a validated, graph-aware specification language. Developers adopt it because their AI agents produce dramatically better results on the first pass — whether generating code, writing documentation, auditing compliance, or managing projects. The CLI is rock-solid, the LSP makes authoring frictionless, and the token reduction (75-86%) is measurable and real. We win the AI-first developer persona by being obviously better than CLAUDE.md within 15 minutes of first use.

**Year 2 (2027): The Platform.** SpecForge becomes the connective tissue across the entire project lifecycle. The Graph Protocol is consumed by coding agents, PM agents, compliance agents, and documentation agents alike. Providers bridge SpecForge to GitHub, Jira, Figma, and CI systems. Engineering managers open a dashboard and see which features are specified, implemented, tested, and passing — derived entirely from the spec graph and test reports. We win the tech lead and engineering manager personas by being the single source of truth they never had.

**Year 3 (2028): The Standard.** SpecForge specs are checked into every serious repository the way package.json or Cargo.toml are today. AI agents of all kinds read the Graph Protocol natively. Cloud-hosted spec graphs enable cross-repository traceability for organizations. Compliance teams use SpecForge to satisfy FDA, ISO 27001, and SOC 2 audit requirements without separate tooling. The extension ecosystem is self-sustaining. Agent framework integrations (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, Claude Code) consume the Graph Protocol as their standard context source. We win the compliance persona by being cheaper, faster, and more developer-friendly than DOORS or Jama.

**The North Star Metric:** Percentage of AI agent tasks that require zero human correction when the agent has access to a SpecForge graph. We believe this number moves from roughly 30% (plain-text context) to over 70% (structured spec graph) in Year 1, and to over 85% with traceability feedback loops in Year 2. This metric applies to all agent tasks — coding, documentation, compliance, PM — not just coding.

## 2. Product Principles

These seven principles govern every feature decision, prioritization trade-off, and design review.

### P1: Developer-First, Always
SpecForge is a developer tool that happens to satisfy enterprise needs — never the reverse. Every feature must pass the test: "Would a solo developer with no manager choose to use this?" If the answer is no, the feature is either redesigned or deprioritized. Enterprise value emerges from developer adoption, not the other way around.

### P2: Seconds to Value
A developer should go from `brew install specforge` to seeing validated output in under 60 seconds. First-run experience is sacred. No accounts, no configuration files, no YAML ceremony. The CLI must work with zero configuration on any project. Every additional feature is opt-in complexity, never mandatory overhead.

### P3: The Spec Is the Source of Truth
The .spec file is not documentation that drifts from code. It is a compiled artifact with validation, graph semantics, and traceability. If something is true in the spec but false in the code, that is a bug in the code. This principle means we invest heavily in validation (36 codes and growing), drift detection, and CI integration — because the spec's authority depends on its accuracy.

### P4: All AI Agents Are First-Class Consumers
Every output format, every graph query, every error message is designed to be consumed by AI agents as much as by humans. The Graph Protocol serves coding agents, PM agents, compliance agents, documentation agents, security agents — any agent performing any task. This means structured output (JSON, not just pretty-printed text), deterministic ordering, stable schemas, multi-resolution queries, and token-efficient representations. We measure output quality not just by human readability but by agent task-completion rates across all task types.

### P5: Zero-Entity Core, Infinite Ecosystem
The compiler core has **zero built-in entity types** — it is a pure typed-graph engine. ALL domain vocabulary comes from installable extensions: `@specforge/software` for software engineering, `@specforge/atomic-design` for UI design, `@specforge/compliance` for regulatory work, `@specforge/api-design` for API specifications, and any domain a community extension author imagines. This is the Terraform-exact model: Terraform core has zero infrastructure knowledge (all in providers), SpecForge core has zero domain knowledge (all in extensions). We would rather ship a clean extension manifest format and let the community build 50 domain extensions than hardcode 50 entity types ourselves.

### P6: Validate Early, Validate Everything
The compiler catches problems before code is written. Dangling references, missing test coverage, orphaned entities, ambiguous naming — these are compile-time errors, not runtime surprises. Every entity relationship is an edge in a validated graph. The cost of finding a specification error should be near zero (seconds in the editor), not thousands of dollars (in production).

### P7: Traceability Is a Product, Not a Report
Traceability (spec to code to test to result) is not a checkbox feature for compliance teams. It is the core feedback loop that makes AI agents self-correcting. When an agent can see that a behavior is specified, partially implemented, and has one failing test, it can fix the failing test. When it cannot see that, it rewrites everything from scratch. Traceability is what makes SpecForge compound in value over time.

---

## 3. User Journey Maps (AI-First Teams — Primary Persona)

### Journey 1: First Encounter (Day 0)

```
Trigger: Developer sees a tweet/blog post showing SpecForge reducing AI agent
         hallucinations by 75%. They are frustrated with their 2000-line CLAUDE.md
         that agents routinely ignore or misinterpret.

Step 1: Install
  $ brew install specforge
  (also: npx specforge, cargo install specforge-cli)
  Time: 10 seconds. No account. No config.

Step 2: Initialize
  $ specforge init
  Creates: spec/project.spec with spec block + 2 example entities
  Time: 5 seconds.

Step 3: First compile
  $ specforge check
  Output: "3 entities, 2 edges, 0 errors, 1 warning (W004: behavior
          'user_login' has no test coverage declared)"
  Moment of truth: The developer sees that SpecForge actually understands
  their specification structure. It is not a linter — it is a compiler.
  Time: 2 seconds.

Step 4: First AI integration
  Developer adds `specforge export --format=context` output to their
  AI agent's context window. The agent completes a task correctly on the
  first attempt that previously took 3 rounds of correction.
  Works for any agent task: coding, documentation, compliance, PM.
  Time: 5 minutes.
  Emotional state: "This is real."

Step 5: Commit
  Developer commits spec/ directory alongside their code.
  SpecForge is now part of the project.
```

### Journey 2: Daily Workflow (Week 2+)

```
Morning: Developer opens IDE. LSP is active. They write a new behavior block.
  - Autocomplete suggests entity references from the graph
  - Inline diagnostics show "W004: no test coverage" as they type
  - Go-to-definition jumps from a reference to the referenced entity

Agent session: Developer delegates a task to any AI agent.
  - Agent reads compiled spec context via Graph Protocol (200 tokens instead of 1400)
  - Coding agent generates code + test stubs matching verify/scenario declarations
  - PM agent generates accurate status report from roadmap + deliverable entities
  - Compliance agent audits constraints + failure modes against implementation

End of day: Developer runs CI pipeline.
  - `specforge check` validates the spec graph (zero errors required)
  - `specforge trace` verifies test linkage (all testable entities covered)
  - `specforge report` shows 94% spec coverage
  - Failed: 1 behavior has a verify declaration but no linked test file (W018)
```

### Journey 3: Onboarding a Teammate (Month 2)

```
New developer joins the project. Instead of reading 40 pages of architecture
docs, they run:

  $ specforge export --format=brief
  Shows all 47 entities, their relationships, coverage status

  $ specforge query "what implements the payment flow?"
  Returns: 3 behaviors, 2 types, 1 port, linked to 5 test files

  $ specforge export --format=context --scope payment
  Generates scoped context for any AI agent: just the payment subgraph

New developer is productive in hours, not days. The spec graph is the
onboarding document that never goes stale.
```

### Journey 4: Scaling to Team (Month 6)

```
Team has 150+ entities across 30 .spec files. They need:
  - Namespace organization (spec/auth/, spec/payments/, spec/infra/)
  - Cross-file references validated at compile time
  - CI gate: `specforge check --strict` fails on any warning
  - Coverage dashboard in PR comments via `specforge report --format github`
  - Selective compilation: `specforge check spec/payments/` for fast iteration

The team has not purchased anything. SpecForge is still a free CLI tool.
The value scales with the project's complexity.
```

## 4. Feature Prioritization Framework

We use a weighted scoring model with four dimensions. Each scored 1-5.

| Dimension | Weight | Definition |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| **Agent Impact** | 35% | Does this feature measurably improve AI agent task-completion rates? |
| **Adoption Friction** | 25% | Does this reduce time-to-value or remove barriers to adoption? (Inverse: high friction = low score) |
| **Ecosystem Leverage** | 20% | Does this enable the community to build on top of SpecForge? |
| **Revenue Proximity** | 20% | Does this create or protect a future revenue opportunity? |

**Scoring rubric:**

- **5 — Transformative.** This feature is why someone adopts SpecForge over the alternative.
- **4 — Significant.** This feature meaningfully improves retention or expansion.
- **3 — Expected.** Users would be surprised if this were missing.
- **2 — Nice-to-have.** Improves experience but not a decision driver.
- **1 — Marginal.** Low impact; build only if trivial.

**Hard gates (any of these = automatic deprioritization):**
- Requires an account or cloud service for basic functionality
- Breaks backward compatibility of the .spec format without a migration path
- Adds mandatory configuration that did not exist before
- Increases cold-start compile time beyond 500ms for a 200-entity project

**Example scoring:**

| Feature | Agent Impact (35%) | Adoption (25%) | Ecosystem (20%) | Revenue (20%) | Weighted |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------|----------|
| Tree-sitter parser with error recovery | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 4.05 |
| Agent-context output format | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 4.00 |
| LSP with autocomplete | 3 | 5 | 3 | 2 | 3.30 |
| Cloud-hosted spec graph | 3 | 2 | 4 | 5 | 3.35 |
| Extension marketplace | 2 | 2 | 5 | 4 | 3.00 |
| Figma provider | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 2.40 |

## 5. MVP Definition

### What "MVP" Means for SpecForge

The MVP is the minimum product that makes an AI-first developer say: **"I am never going back to plain CLAUDE.md."** This is a high bar. It requires not just parsing a file but delivering a validated graph that demonstrably improves agent output quality for any task.

### MVP: In Scope

| Component | Scope | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Parser** | Tree-sitter grammar with generic entity block rule (zero hardcoded entity types). Multi-error recovery. | Core compiler. No parser = no product. Error recovery is non-negotiable because .spec files are edited live. |
| **Semantic model** | Entity graph with all 20 edge types. String interning via lasso. petgraph-backed. | The graph is the product. Without validated edges, we are just a linter. |
| **Validation** | Core structural validation codes + extension-contributed codes. Dangling reference detection. Cycle detection. | Validation is what separates SpecForge from a text file. Every error caught at compile time is a round-trip saved with the AI agent. |
| **CLI** | `specforge init`, `specforge check`, `specforge export`. Three commands. | Init for onboarding. Check for CI. Export for agent consumption. These three cover the entire MVP workflow. |
| **Output: Graph Protocol** | JSON output format optimized for AI agent consumption. Token-efficient. Deterministic. Multiple formats: context (token-optimized), graph (complete), brief (minimal). | This is the killer feature. The reason someone installs SpecForge is to feed structured context to any AI agent. |
| **Output: human-readable** | Pretty-printed terminal output with ariadne diagnostics. | Developers need to read error messages. ariadne gives us Rust-compiler-quality diagnostics for free. |
| **Default extensions** | Ship `@specforge/software`, `@specforge/product`, and `@specforge/governance` as optional, installable extensions (not built into core). `specforge init` offers interactive extension selection. | These extensions provide the entities most teams need. The core compiler has zero built-in entity types — all vocabulary comes from extensions. |
| **Distribution** | brew, npx, cargo install, GitHub releases (Linux/macOS/Windows). | Four channels cover 95%+ of the developer audience. npx for zero-install trial. |
| **Spec format v1** | Stable .spec grammar with backward-compatibility commitment. | Developers will not adopt a format that breaks. v1 stability is a trust signal. |

### MVP: Out of Scope (and Why)

| Component | Deferred To | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **LSP** | Q2 | The LSP is high-value but not required for the "aha" moment. The CLI alone proves the concept. LSP is a retention feature, not an acquisition feature. |
| **Agent framework integrations** | Q3 | AI agents consume the Graph Protocol to perform their tasks. SpecForge provides structured context; agents produce output. Code generation is the agent's job, not SpecForge's. |
| **Providers (GitHub, Jira, Figma)** | Q3-Q4 | External integrations multiply the maintenance surface. The MVP must prove value with zero external dependencies. |
| **Watch mode** | Q2 | Nice-to-have for iteration speed. Not required for first value. |
| **Cloud/web dashboard** | Q5+ | Premature. No cloud until the CLI has proven product-market fit with thousands of users. |
| **`specforge trace` / test report consumption** | Q3 | Traceability requires the test ecosystem (proc macros, JUnit parsing) which is a large surface area. Ship the spec compiler first. |
| **`specforge query`** | Q3 | Graph querying is powerful but not required for MVP. `export --format context --scope X` covers the 80% use case. |
| **`scenario` blocks** | Q2 | verify blocks alone are sufficient for MVP test declarations. Scenarios add Gherkin-style complexity that can wait. |
| **User-defined types (`define` blocks)** | Q3 | Extension-provided entity types cover most projects. `define` blocks add user-level extensibility beyond extensions. |

### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP ships when all of the following are true:

1. A developer can go from `brew install specforge` to validated output in under 60 seconds.
2. `specforge check` catches at least 5 real error classes that would cause an AI agent to generate incorrect code.
3. `specforge export --format=context` produces output that is 70%+ smaller than equivalent plain-text context while preserving all semantic information.
4. The compiler handles 200+ entities with sub-500ms compile time.
5. The .spec format is documented with a language reference and 10+ example files.
6. At least 3 real-world projects (including SpecForge itself) are self-hosting on the MVP.

---

## 7. Platform Strategy (CLI - LSP - Cloud - IDE Extensions)

### Layer 1: CLI (Q1 — permanent foundation)

The CLI is the atomic unit of SpecForge. Everything else builds on it.

**Design principles:**
- Zero configuration required. `specforge check` works in any directory with .spec files.
- Machine-readable output on every command (`--format json`). CI systems and AI agents are first-class consumers.
- Sub-second execution for typical projects. The compiler is fast because it is written in Rust and the spec graph is small relative to code.
- The CLI is the single binary. No daemon, no background process, no server. Stateless by default.

**Why CLI first:** Developer tools that start with a GUI or a cloud service get adoption wrong. The CLI proves the core value proposition (validated spec graph - better AI output) with zero friction. It is also the integration point for CI, for AI agents, and for other tools. Everything else is a layer on top.

### Layer 2: LSP (Q2 — developer experience)

The LSP is how SpecForge becomes a daily-use tool rather than a CI gate.

**Capabilities by phase:**
- **LSP v0.1 (Q2):** Diagnostics, go-to-definition, hover info, document symbols
- **LSP v0.2 (Q3):** Autocomplete for entity references, rename symbol across files
- **LSP v1.0 (Q4):** Code actions (quick fixes), workspace-wide diagnostics, semantic tokens for rich highlighting

**Architecture:** The LSP binary (`specforge-lsp`) shares the parser library with the CLI binary (`specforge-cli`). The mutable graph (architectural decision from day 1) enables incremental updates on every keystroke without full recompilation.

### Layer 3: IDE Extensions (Q2-Q4 — reach)

**Priority order:**
1. **VS Code** (Q2) — 70%+ market share among target persona.
2. **Neovim** (Q2) — LSP works natively, syntax highlighting via tree-sitter grammar.
3. **JetBrains** (Q5) — Significant enterprise market share but lower priority.
4. **Zed** (Q6) — Growing AI-first editor. Natural fit but smaller user base.

**Extension scope:** IDE extensions are thin clients. They provide syntax highlighting, LSP integration, and convenience commands. All intelligence lives in the LSP.

### Layer 4: Cloud (Q7+ — monetization and team features)

The cloud layer is deliberately deferred to Q7. Premature cloud features would distract from core compiler quality.

**Cloud features (when ready):**
- Hosted spec graph with web dashboard
- Team permissions and role-based access
- Cross-repository traceability
- Spec coverage trends over time
- Webhook integrations (Slack notifications on spec coverage regressions)
- API access for custom integrations

**Pricing model (preliminary):**
- Free: CLI, LSP, all local features, community extensions. Forever.
- Team ($20/user/month): Cloud dashboard, cross-repo traceability, team permissions.
- Enterprise ($50/user/month): SSO, audit logs, compliance reports, SLA.

## 8. Ecosystem Strategy

### Extension Taxonomy

| Extension Type | Purpose | Examples | Distribution |
|---------------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Domain extensions** | Add entity kinds, edges, and validation rules | `@specforge/software`, `@specforge/product`, `@specforge/governance`, `@community/security` | Registry (future), git repos (near-term) |
| **Providers** | Validate external references | `@specforge/gh`, `@specforge/jira`, `@specforge/figma` | Same |
| **Renderers** | Produce non-code outputs from the graph | `@specforge/rtm-renderer`, `@community/mermaid-renderer` | Same |
| **Test collectors** | Consume test runner output, emit specforge-report.json | `@specforge/rust`, `@specforge/vitest` | Same |

### Phase 1: First-Party Ecosystem (Q1-Q4)

We build the first 8-10 extensions ourselves:
- 3 domain extensions: `@specforge/software`, `@specforge/product`, `@specforge/governance` (optional, installed via `specforge init`)
- 2 providers: `@specforge/gh`, `@specforge/jira`
- 1 test collector: `@specforge/rust` (JUnit XML → specforge-report.json + proc macro crate)
- 1 renderer: `@specforge/rtm-renderer` (traceability matrix output)

### Phase 2: Community Ecosystem (Q5-Q8)

**Community extension opportunities:**

| Category | High-Value Extensions |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Domain extensions** | `@community/security` (threat models), `@community/data` (schemas, migrations), `@community/api-design` (endpoints, operations), `@community/atomic-design` (atoms, molecules, organisms) |
| **Providers** | Linear, Notion, Confluence, Azure DevOps, GitLab |
| **Test collectors** | pytest, Go testing, JUnit, Playwright, k6, Cypress |
| **Renderers** | Mermaid diagrams, C4 diagrams, OpenAPI spec export, compliance RTMs |

### Phase 3: Marketplace (Q7+)

A hosted registry where community extensions are published, versioned, and discovered. Free to publish, free to install. Revenue comes from the cloud platform, not the marketplace.

---

## 9. AI-Native Features

### 9.1 AI-Assisted Authoring — Q5-Q6

LSP-integrated AI suggestions while writing .spec files: suggest descriptions, missing edges, and verify blocks based on existing spec context. Reduces the authoring effort from hours to minutes. Note: SpecForge does not infer specs from code — the spec is the source of truth, not the code.

### 9.2 Agent SDK — Q5-Q6

Programmatic API for any AI agent to read, query, and consume the spec graph. Integration targets: Claude Code, Cursor, LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, Continue.dev.

### 9.3 Diff-Aware Context — Q5

`specforge export --diff HEAD~1` outputs only the entities and edges that changed. Estimated 90%+ token reduction for incremental agent tasks of any type.

### 9.4 Natural Language Queries — Q6

`specforge ask "what depends on the payment system?"` translates natural language to graph queries.

### 9.5 AI-Assisted Authoring — Q6

LSP-integrated AI suggestions while writing .spec files: suggest descriptions, missing edges, verify/scenario blocks.

### 9.6 Autonomous Feedback Loop — Q6

Closes the loop: Agent reads spec graph → performs task → results feed back into graph → agent sees gaps → agent fixes. Works for any agent type: coding agent sees failing tests, PM agent sees missing deliverables, compliance agent sees unmitigated risks. The ultimate value proposition.

## 10. Success Metrics Per Feature

### Core Metrics (tracked continuously)

| Metric | Definition | Target (Y1) | Target (Y2) |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Weekly Active CLI Users** | Unique users running any `specforge` command per week | 5,000 | 50,000 |
| **Spec Files in Public Repos** | GitHub code search for `.spec` files with SpecForge syntax | 1,000 | 25,000 |
| **Agent Task Completion Rate** | % of AI agent tasks (any type) completed correctly on first attempt with spec context vs. without | +40% improvement | +60% improvement |
| **Time to First Value** | Median time from install to first successful `specforge check` | <60 seconds | <30 seconds |
| **NPS (Developer)** | Net Promoter Score from in-CLI survey (quarterly, opt-in) | 50+ | 60+ |

### Funnel Metrics

```
Install (brew/npx/cargo)
  | (Target: 80% proceed)
First `specforge check`
  | (Target: 60% proceed)
10+ entities authored
  | (Target: 40% proceed)
Used in AI agent context (agent-context output)
  | (Target: 30% proceed)
Added to CI pipeline
  | (Target: 15% proceed)
Team adoption (3+ developers)
  | (Target: 5% proceed)
Cloud plan (paid)
```

**Key conversion to monitor:** The drop from "first check" to "10+ entities authored" is the critical funnel step. Mitigation: `specforge infer` (Q5), AI-assisted authoring (Q6), and excellent documentation (continuous).
