# SpecForge Diagnostic Codes

<!-- Generated file: do not edit by hand. -->

This page is generated from the catalog table in `crates/specforge-diagnostics/src/catalog.rs`,
the single registry of diagnostic codes; `specforge explain <CODE>` prints the
same text. Every code emitted by the compiler, the CLI, or a first-party
extension has exactly one entry, and each entry names its owner: `core` for the
compiler and CLI, or the `@specforge/<name>` extension that emits it. The
compiler and CLI name each code through a typed constant generated from this
table (`specforge_diagnostics::codes`), and a test fails when a code an
extension emits is missing here, belongs to another owner, or when a listed
code is never emitted.

Codes follow the pattern `E###` (error), `W###` (warning) and `I###` (info);
`A###` codes are `specforge analyze` findings, whose severity the pass sets.
The registry client keeps its own family, `R###` and `R-<AREA>-###`, whose
prefix doesn't state the severity; no other family is accepted. Each entry's
`Level` is the severity a diagnostic of that code has when it is reported;
`specforge check --strict` raises warnings to errors afterwards. A code an
extension reports at another level, or a code it does not own, is reported as
W150. The ranges
`E900`-`E998`, `W900`-`W998` and `I900`-`I998` are reserved for third-party
extensions and never appear in this catalog; `I999` is a core code.

A001: Testable entity without obligations

`specforge analyze coverage` found a testable entity (one whose kind an
extension declares testable) that declares no `verify` obligations, so nothing
states what a test must prove about it. Add `verify unit "..."` (or another
obligation kind) statements. What W004 exempts (union types, abstract entities,
governance kinds) is not reported.

Owner: @specforge/testing
Level: set by the analyze pass
```

## A002

```
A002: Invariant without obligations

An invariant declares no `verify` obligations. It is an error when the
invariant's `risk` is `high`, a warning otherwise. Add a `verify property` or
`verify unit` statement stating how the guarantee is checked.

Owner: @specforge/testing
Level: set by the analyze pass
```

## A010

```
A010: Entity without contract obligations

`specforge analyze contracts` found an entity whose kind registers contract
reference fields (`requires`, `ensures`, `maintains`, ...) that declares none of
them, so no invariant constrains it. Add the references, or ignore this
info-level finding for entities that need none.

Owner: core
Level: set by the analyze pass
```

## A014

```
A014: Failing tests

The recorded test results (`specforge-report.json`, written by `specforge
collect`) include failing tests for this entity, so what it promises is not
proven. Fix the code or the test and run `specforge collect` again.

Owner: @specforge/testing
Level: set by the analyze pass
```

## A015

```
A015: Unproven obligations

With recorded test results, some of an entity's `verify` obligations are named
by no passing test. A test proves an obligation by naming its exact text:
`verify = "..."` in `#[specforge_test(...)]`, or in a vitest test's
`meta.specforge`. Link a test to each listed obligation, or write the missing
tests.

Owner: @specforge/testing
Level: set by the analyze pass
```

## A016

```
A016: Test names an undeclared obligation

A recorded test names a `verify` obligation that its entity does not declare,
usually a typo or an obligation reworded in the spec. The test proves nothing
until its text matches the spec's statement exactly; fix whichever side is
wrong.

E001: Parse error

A `.spec` file could not be parsed — invalid syntax such as a missing brace,
unclosed string, or malformed field at the reported location; the same code also

parser producing no syntax tree at all. Fix the syntax at the reported span and

E019: Unsupported format version

E027: Unsatisfiable peer dependency

An extension's required peer dependency can't be satisfied: it isn't installed,
the installed version doesn't match the required range, peer dependencies form a

E028: Extension load or execution failure

An extension failed somewhere in its lifecycle: its binary is missing,
unreadable or does not load as a component (a `.wasm` file entry of
`specforge.json` also when the file declares another name than the entry writes,
or an extension another entry already loads); its handshake or one of its
describe categories failed or does not parse, so its declaration cannot be read
(`specforge add` and `specforge publish` refuse such a binary); or a call the
host makes on the loaded extension failed. The host calls ten exports: the
handshake and describe, a command, an MCP tool, an MCP resource, a compiler
pass, a collector, a custom validator, a scanner and the migration hook. Each
call fails when the export traps (a limit of its sandbox included: its time, its
fuel or its memory, the trap naming which), when the extension does not route
it, or when it answers output that is not the protocol type the operation owes;
the message names the operation, the export and the extension (`command cmd__x()
of '@acme/x' trapped: ...`). What the failure costs is the operation's: a check
pass's is the compile's error, an analyze pass's a finding of that pass, a
scanner's makes `infer` approximate. Report the failure to the extension's
author, and confirm the extension is installed and up to date.

Owner: core
Level: error

## E030

```
E030: Invalid extension declaration

An extension's declaration (its handshake and describe answers) can't be used as
declared: its name or version is empty, its `ext_short` isn't lowercase kebab
case (`[a-z][a-z0-9-]*`; it names the extension's CLI subcommand and MCP tool
prefix), or an analyzer has no language, no file extensions or an empty export
name. The registry build reports it on every load, and `specforge publish`
refuses such a binary before any network call. Fix the declaration in the
extension's source (with the SDK: `#[extension(name, version, short)]` and the
builders) and rebuild it.

E031: Refinement drops ensures condition

A behavior that `refines` an `abstract` behavior drops one or more of the

declares `sync`. The message gives one cycle path. Declare a `sync` constraint

`specforge remove` refuse (config_invalid) without changing anything. When a key
has the wrong type (`name`, `version` or `spec_root` not a string, `exclude` not
an array), that key's default is used; when an item of `extensions` or `exclude`
isn't a string, that item is ignored; the rest of the file is used. Each problem

A name that must be a package name is not one, or a version that must be a

`specforge add` installs it, a peer a declaration names, a `specforge.json`
`extensions` entry (the entry is not loaded), the name `specforge remove` is
given, and the name and version of the declaration `specforge publish` uploads

I011: Ensures without requires

`specforge analyze`'s `condition_check` pass found a `behavior` that declares an
`ensures` clause but no `requires` clause, so it guarantees its postconditions

I014: Specification depth

`specforge analyze`'s `coverage_tracking` pass reports a `behavior`'s
specification depth, a ladder in which each level holds the one below it:
`prose` (no edges), `entity_graph` (edges, no requires or ensures), `conditions`
(level 2: requires or ensures), `invariants` (level 3: also names invariants in
`maintains` or `invariants`) and `proofs` (level 4: also proven under
@specforge/testing's coverage rule). A behavior at level 2 or deeper is reported
with the step to the next level. When more than five behaviors sit at `prose` or
`entity_graph`, one more I014 suggests adding requires/ensures to the critical

I017: Extension surface not served under its name

MCP serves each name once (ADR 0017): the core tools and resources first, then
each extension's explicit MCP tools and resources in extension load order, then
its commands as the tools `specforge.<ext>.<command>`. A contribution not served
under its name is reported here, with why: an explicit tool named as a core tool
or an earlier extension's tool; a resource whose URIs a core resource or an
earlier extension resource already serves; a command whose tool name an explicit
tool (or a core tool) already has; a command the host refuses (an arg taking
`--path`, `--format` or `--help`, two args spelling one option, or a default its
declaration contradicts); a command another extension of the same short name
routes first. Only MCP reports it, so `specforge check` does not. Rename the
