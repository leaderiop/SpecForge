# event

> **Module:** `core`

## Purpose

An `event` declares a **domain or system event** — something the system announces when a significant state change occurs. Events are the contracts between producers and consumers: a behavior emits an event, and other behaviors (possibly in different bounded contexts or services) react to it.

It answers: **"What does the system announce?"**

Events make the system's reactive behavior explicit and traceable. Without events, the connections between "user created" and "welcome email sent" are hidden in implementation code. With events, the compiler can trace the full chain: behavior produces event, event consumed by behavior, that behavior references invariants, etc.

## ID Pattern

```
identifier
```

Examples: `user_created`, `email_changed`, `order_placed`

## Syntax

```spec
use "types/user"
use "behaviors/user-crud"

event user_created "User Created" {
  trigger   create_user
  channel   "users.created"

  payload {
    userId    string
    email     string
    role      UserRole
    timestamp timestamp
  }

  consumers [send_notification, log_audit]
}
```

## Fields

### Required

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `trigger` | reference | The behavior that produces this event. Must reference an existing `behavior`. |

### Optional

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `title` | string | Human-readable name (the string after the identifier). Optional — auto-derived from identifier if omitted. |
| `payload` | block | The event data shape — fields with types. Defines the contract between producer and consumers. |
| `channel` | string | Logical channel, topic, or queue name. Used for AsyncAPI generation and documentation. |
| `consumers` | reference list | Behaviors that react to this event. Enables cross-context traceability. |
| `refs` | reference list | External references (issues, tickets, diagrams) linked to this event. |

### Payload Fields

Payload fields follow the same syntax as `type` fields:

```spec
payload {
  fieldName  fieldType
  fieldName  fieldType  @annotation
}
```

Supported annotations: `@readonly`, `@optional`.

## Relationships

### Incoming edges

| From | Edge Type | Meaning |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `behavior` | `produces` | "This behavior emits this event" (via the `trigger` field) |

### Outgoing edges

| To | Edge Type | Meaning |
|----|-----------|---------|
| `behavior` | `consumes` | "This event is consumed by these behaviors" |
| `ref` | `links_to` | "This event links to these external references" |

## Validation Rules

| Code | Rule |
|------|------|
| E001 | The `trigger` must resolve to an existing `behavior`. |
| E001 | Every ID in `consumers` must resolve to an existing `behavior`. |
| E002 | No two events may share the same ID. |
| E006 | The trigger behavior must exist and be a valid behavior entity. |
| W007 | If `consumers` is empty or omitted, emit "orphan event" warning. |

## Design Guidance

### Good Events

Events should:
- **Describe what happened, not what to do** — "UserCreated" not "SendWelcomeEmail"
- **Be past tense** — "OrderPlaced", "PaymentProcessed", "SessionExpired"
- **Carry sufficient data** — consumers should not need to call back to the producer
- **Be immutable** — once published, the payload never changes

### Event vs. Behavior

| Event | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| Describes what *happened* | Describes what the system *does* |
| Past tense ("UserCreated") | Imperative ("Create User") |
| Published after a state change | Defines the operation that causes the state change |
| Consumed by other behaviors | Referenced by features |

### Event Payload Design

Payloads should include:
- **Identity** — enough to identify the affected entity (e.g., `userId`)
- **Key data** — the data consumers need without round-tripping (e.g., `email`, `role`)
- **Timestamp** — when the event occurred
- **Minimal but sufficient** — don't include the entire entity; include what consumers need

### Cross-Context Events

Events are the primary mechanism for traceability across bounded contexts. When a behavior in the "Users" context produces `user_created`, and a behavior in the "Notifications" context consumes it, the compiler can trace the full chain even though the contexts are otherwise independent.

## Related Entities

| Direction | Entity | Edge | Meaning |
|-----------|--------|------|---------|
| outgoing | [behavior](behavior.md) | `consumes` | Behaviors triggered by this event |
| outgoing | [ref](ref.md) | `links_to` | External references linked to this event |
| incoming | [behavior](behavior.md) | `produces` | Behaviors that emit this event |

## Examples

### Simple Event

```spec
event user_created "User Created" {
  trigger   create_user
  channel   "users.created"

  payload {
    userId    string
    email     string
    role      UserRole
    timestamp timestamp
  }

  consumers [send_notification, log_audit]
}
```

### Event Without Consumers (Yet)

```spec
event email_changed "User Email Changed" {
  trigger   update_email
  channel   "users.email-changed"

  payload {
    userId    string
    oldEmail  string
    newEmail  string
    timestamp timestamp
  }

  // No consumers yet — will emit W007 orphan event warning.
  // This is fine during early development.
}
```

### Cross-Service Event

```spec
use "behaviors/order-processing"

event order_placed "Order Placed" {
  trigger   place_order
  channel   "orders.placed"

  payload {
    orderId     string
    customerId  string
    items       OrderItem[]
    totalAmount number
    currency    string
    timestamp   timestamp
  }

  consumers [
    begin_fulfillment,   // Fulfillment service: begin picking
    charge_payment,      // Billing service: charge payment
    send_order_confirm,  // Notification service: send confirmation
    log_order_audit,     // Audit service: log order event
  ]

  refs [mermaid:order-event-flow]
}
```

### Event Chain (Event Triggers Event)

```spec
event payment_processed "Payment Processed" {
  trigger   charge_payment    // This behavior is itself a consumer of order_placed
  channel   "billing.payment-processed"

  payload {
    orderId       string
    paymentId     string
    amount        number
    currency      string
    paymentMethod string
    timestamp     timestamp
  }

  consumers [complete_fulfillment, send_payment_confirm]
}
```
