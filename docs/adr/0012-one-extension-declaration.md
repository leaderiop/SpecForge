# One extension declaration

**Status:** accepted (2026-10-05)

An extension's declaration (who it is, and the kinds, fields, edges, rules, enhancements,
surfaces, collectors, analyzers, passes and feature flags it contributes) was written once, in
the SDK, as `specforge-protocol-types` descriptors, then copied by the host into a second,
camelCase family (`ManifestV2`, `ManifestEntityKind`, `ManifestField`, …, a registry
`SandboxPolicy`), field by field, through a hand-written bridge. That family's only remaining
reason to exist was the `manifest.json` that `specforge publish` uploaded. Every copy lost
something: the SDK's `short` never reached the host, an extension declaring only commands (or
only passes) loaded with none of them, a field's `default_value` was dropped before the field
registry, passes were described twice more outside the load with their parse errors swallowed,
and `add`'s diamond gate trusted peers a publisher typed into `manifest.json` while the load's
E027 trusted the binary.

## D1. The protocol descriptors are the declaration

`specforge_protocol_types::ExtensionDeclaration` is the handshake plus every describe category
the host reads (`DECLARED_CATEGORIES`), typed. The SDK builds it
(`ContributionsBuilder::declaration`), the guest serves it (`describe_items`), the host loads it
(`ExtensionDeclaration::from_wire`), the registry build reads it and a package registry stores
it. There is no host-side mirror, no bridge and no `manifest.json`. A new declared field costs
one optional field on one type.

## D2. The loader asks every category, whatever the flags say

`specforge_wasm::protocol::load_declaration` reads the handshake (protocol major checked,
sandbox deadline applied) and then every declared category, unconditionally: 1 + 10 calls per
extension per environment load, and nothing describes a category again. Contribution flags are
derived from the content (`ExtensionDeclaration::contribution_flags`) and stay on the wire for
compatibility; only `providers`, which has no describe category, is read from them. Every guest
is SDK-built (ADR 0004, 0011) and the SDK answers every supported category, `[]` when empty, so
no guest breaks; command-only and passes-only extensions now load what they declare.

## D3. `fields` is derived

The `fields` category is every kind's fields, concatenated (`describe_items("fields")`); the
host never reads it and the builtins' hand-written copies (2,459 lines) are gone. What the host
reads as extension-wide fields is `shared_fields`.

## D6. Publish derives the stored declaration from the binary

`specforge publish [PATH]` (a `.wasm` component, or a crate whose
`target/wasm32-wasip2/release/*.wasm` is taken) loads the binary, loads its declaration, runs the
registry build over it alone, refuses on an error before any network call, and uploads the
declaration's JSON as the package's manifest. The publisher signature already binds the exact
manifest bytes and the binary's hash. The server parses an `ExtensionDeclaration`, checks its
identity against the URL, refuses `sandbox_policy.network_access`, and takes the description and
keywords it shows from the handshake. Rejected: the server deriving the declaration itself (it
would link wasmtime and execute uploaded code; the check in D7 gives the same guarantee).

## D7. `add` verifies the served declaration against the binary

`Package` carries the served `declaration` (replacing its `peers`). The diamond gate decides on
`declaration.peers()` before anything is loaded (ADR 0001's order); after loading, the binary's
declaration must equal the served one, field for field, else `METADATA_MISMATCH` naming the first
differing category. This refines ADR 0010: `Registry::fetch` returns a `Package` whose
declaration is checked against its binary, after the identity check.

## D8. No camelCase form is kept

The stored manifest is the snake_case protocol JSON. A package published before this change (its
stored manifest has `manifestVersion`) is refused by `add` and `update` with
`UNREADABLE_MANIFEST` and the suggestion to re-publish it with this version of `specforge
publish`. Rejected: a read-only legacy reader (it keeps a camelCase type alive for packages no
public registry holds, ADR 0004 N1) and a server-side rewrite (it would invalidate the publisher
signature over the manifest's hash).

## D11. The registry build owns declaration validation; the environment keeps runtime failures

`build_registries(Vec<ExtensionDeclaration>) -> RegistryBuild` checks the declarations
themselves (E030 identity and shape, W021 consistency against the loaded peers, E027 peer
dependencies, W145 pass order cycles, in that order, extension by extension within each),
orders each extension's passes (`RegistryBuild::passes`, `check_passes()`, `analyze_passes()`)
and populates the registries; it is pure. `Environment::diagnostics()` reports, in order: the
runtime's load failures (E028/E033) in load order, unknown describe keys (W138), the
declarations' own diagnostics, provider registration (W118/E057), I002, then the registry
build's. E028 and E030 used to interleave extension by extension; a consumer diffing `check`
output sees them reordered only when both occur in one project.

## D13. W138 and E030 are re-scoped, not retired; W145 is new

W138 is a describe item key the protocol does not define (a typo in a hand-written
`raw_category` item, or SDK/host skew), reported at load. E030 is an invalid extension
declaration: an empty name or version, an `ext_short` that is not lowercase kebab case, an
analyzer without a language, file extensions or exports. W145 is a pass order cycle, which keeps
declaration order (it was an `eprintln!` the LSP and MCP sent to stderr).

## Consequences

- One type family from the SDK to the package registry; the registries embed the descriptor
  they were built from (`FieldRegistryEntry::declared`, …), so a declared field reaches every
  reader (`default_value`, `inference_guide`, a kind's `incremental`).
- The SDK's `short` routes commands (`specforge <short> <command>`, MCP `specforge.<short>.*`);
  the macro refuses a `short` that is not lowercase kebab case at compile time.
- The handshake carries the extension's `description` and `keywords`; every builtin describes
  itself.
- The nine builtins declare with the SDK builders instead of ~7.9k lines of hand-written
  describe JSON; their exact wire answers are pinned under
  `crates/specforge-component/tests/declarations/` (`xtask snapshot-builtins` writes them).
- `manifest.json` is no longer read anywhere; `specforge extension init|build|validate` work on
  an SDK crate and its built component.
- The host-side code that only the mirror family fed (the manifest bridge, sidecar discovery,
  contribution-export checks, query extensions, upgrade) is deleted with it, and the diagnostics
  only it emitted are retired: E017, E018, E020, E023, E035, W028, W116, W117.
- `specforge-wasm` no longer depends on `specforge-registry`: the loader produces the declaration
  the registry build consumes.

## What would reopen it

- A host that needs a declaration without loading the extension's code: then a signed,
  server-verified derivation of the declaration.
- A category too large to describe on every load: then a batched describe and a minor protocol
  version.
