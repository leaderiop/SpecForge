# One extension surface table; the host normalizes command args

**Status:** accepted (2026-10-06)

An extension command is derived for each surface, and an extension surface was looked up five ways:

- **The derivation was split across three modules in three crates.** MCP's `registry.rs` flattened each
  declared arg to a `(name, "type")` string pair, the runtime crate (`specforge_wasm::surface`) turned
  those strings back into a JSON Schema and chose the tool's name, then `derived_input_schema` patched
  enum values, descriptions and `required` back in: never a default, never a minimum, and every
  required arg required, flags included. The CLI derived its own command line from the same
  declaration with other rules: it filled `default_value`, made a required flag optional and sent
  `false` for an unset flag. MCP passed the client's arguments as they came.
- **The SDK masked the default drift for SDK guests only.** It applied the default and checked the
  types guest-side (`CommandCall`); a guest declaring raw JSON got neither over MCP. Its host-option
  list duplicated the host's and compared names exactly, while the host spells `_` and `-` alike.
- **MCP served extension surfaces from four parallel structures joined by name at call time**
  (`tool_registry`, `resource_registry`, the registry's surfaces plus MCP's promoted ones, and the raw
  declarations for the command id and URI template). The joins were the bugs: no extension resource
  could be read (2fb7aa26: its URI was matched against the entry's name), a refused command was still
  promoted (49bfb73c), schemas came from a second lookup (d0f13f05, 375c23cf); a duplicate name was
  listed twice and dispatched once, and an extension tool named `specforge.validate` was listed beside
  the core tool and never dispatched. `registry.rs` had 17 fix commits in a month.
- **One tool answered with two error shapes.** A missing `milestone` was an McpError
  (`invalid_input`, a schema violation), `limit: -1` passed the schema (no `minimum`) and the guest
  answered its own `INVALID_INPUT`; the CLI's message for the same mistake differed again.
- **An extension resource failure was -32602 with its E028 code only in the message**, the one MCP
  path breaking `mcp_structured_error_responses`; a template outside `specforge://ext/` was listed and
  never readable.

## Decision

**D1. The derivation is one module in `specforge-ops`.** `specforge_ops::command::ExtensionCommand`
derives a declared command once, for every surface: its CLI name, its tool name
(`specforge.{short}.{id}`), each arg's value kind (`ArgValue`) and command-line shape (`ArgShape`: a
required arg that is not a flag is positional, every flag is a `--flag`), its typed default, the
tool's input schema, the args both surfaces send (`normalize`) and its refusal.
`ExtensionCommands` routes a project's commands by (short name, CLI name). The runtime crate keeps
the call seam and no naming or schema (`specforge_wasm::surface` is deleted).

**D2. The arg rule is one function, in `specforge-protocol-types`, run by the host and the SDK.**
`command_args::{normalize_arg, normalize_args, ArgError, refusal, HOST_OPTIONS}`: drift between guest
and host is impossible by construction. `CommandArgDescriptor` gains an optional `minimum` (wire
compatible both ways; a new closed-enum arg type would make an older host refuse a newer guest), set
to 0 by the SDK's `count()`. The builtins were re-vendored once.

**D3. Defaults are applied by the host, on both surfaces, and advertised.** An absent arg takes its
declared default, an unset flag is `false` (a flag is never required), each value is its declared
type (an integer or flag may come as the string a command line gives). The schema states each arg's
`default` (`false` for a flag) and `minimum`.

**D4. An undeclared argument is refused on every surface** (`additionalProperties: false`;
`unknown argument 'x'`, with the declared name it is close to).

**D5. A command tool's argument errors are the command's error object.** The host refuses before
the export runs with `ArgError::to_json()`, the `{code: INVALID_INPUT, message, suggestion?}` the CLI
writes under `--format json` for the same mistake (the CLI maps clap's usage errors onto the same
`ArgError`s). An explicit `mcp__` tool keeps the McpError schema checks: its schema is opaque JSON
to the host (ADR 0004 D4-a).

**D6. An extension resource failure is -32603 with an McpError in `data`** carrying the E028
diagnostic (`data.diagnostic.code`). "Unknown resource URI" stays -32602 for core and extension alike.

**D7. The table is the only authority on what MCP serves; each name once, first wins, I017 says why.**
`specforge_mcp::surface_table::ExtensionSurfaceTable`, built from the declarations whenever the
served environment loads (`McpState::applied`, `serve`) and emptied on shutdown, holds the tools
(an explicit `mcp__` tool with its schemas, or an `ExtensionCommand`) and the resources (with their
URI template). Precedence: core tools, explicit tools by extension load order, then commands by load
and declaration order. Not served, each with an I017 naming why: an explicit tool named as a core or
earlier tool, a resource whose URIs a core or earlier resource serves, a command whose tool name is
taken, a command the host refuses, a command another extension of the same short name routes first.
I017's title widens to "Extension surface not served under its name" (MCP-only: `check` keeps E039
for cross-extension duplicates).

**D8. Listing order is unchanged:** core in table order, explicit extension tools, then commands;
resources core then extension. `McpState` keeps one field, `surfaces`; listings are
`CORE_TOOLS`/`CORE_RESOURCES` then the table; a call is one lookup in it, then one of two adapters
(`mcp_tool_adapter`, `command_adapter`; plus the resource adapter), each one call across the
`WasmRuntime` seam through `ExtensionCalls` (ADR 0013).

**D9. An extension resource is matched by its template alone, after the core resources**, whatever
its scheme (the `specforge://ext/` gate goes). A template whose URI (each `{..}` probed with `x`) a
core resource or an earlier extension resource matches is not served.

**D10. Tests go through the seam.** `FakeExtension` declares tools and resources (`with_tool`,
`with_resource`, `declaring`) beside commands; no test injects descriptors into the state.

**D11. `short` is the declaration's** (`ExtensionDeclaration::short`, the SDK's `short` as
`ext_short`, else the name's last segment, ADR 0012).

**D12. Declaration contradictions are refusals on both surfaces**: a default its type refuses, a flag
with a default, a required arg with a default (with the host options and two args spelling one
option). The SDK panics on the same `refusal` when the extension is built, and on a required flag or
an empty `one_of`; the host holds a raw-JSON guest to the same rule, its required flag a flag.

**D13. Two extensions with one short name:** the first in load order routes a CLI name on both
surfaces; the later is reported (I017 over MCP, a note on stderr on the CLI).

**D14. Every project a call reaches has an extension runtime.** The served session's, the host's, one
built for a project served in memory, or the one-shot compile's for another project: so
`target::ProjectRef::runtime` is not optional, and the "the project has no extension runtime"
branches of the tool, resource, migrate, collect and gaps handlers (each answering differently: an
internal error, invalid params, a skipped pass) were unreachable and are deleted. Analyze always runs
the extensions' passes in the project's runtime. A served graph with no project root has no project:
an extension call on it is `precondition_failed` (-32602 with that McpError for a resource).

## Consequences

- Over MCP an auto-promoted command now receives its declared defaults and `false` for an unset flag
  (a non-SDK guest too); `call.is_set("<flag>")` is `true` over MCP as on the command line.
- A required flag is no longer required over MCP. An agent sending an undeclared argument (such as
  `format`) gets `INVALID_INPUT` instead of having it silently ignored; a command tool's argument
  errors are `INVALID_INPUT` objects with the CLI's messages, not `invalid_input` McpErrors with
  `violations`, and no `surface_command_dispatched` event is recorded for a refused call.
- `tools/list` shows each command arg's `default`, its `minimum`, and `additionalProperties: false`
  (the product listing: 40 tools, 29 counts with `"minimum": 0`; its order is byte-identical).
- `specforge product features --limit -1` is refused by the command line (exit 2, `INVALID_INPUT`),
  and a count's message is "must be a non-negative integer, got 'abc'" on every surface (the SDK used
  to quote JSON-style `"abc"`).
- Duplicate tool names disappear from `tools/list`, and new I017 infos say why (none for the
  builtins). An extension resource template of any scheme is readable; one a core resource serves is
  not listed. An extension resource failure is -32603 with an McpError carrying E028.
- `resources/list` spells MCP's `mimeType` (it wrote `mime_type`).
- The builtins were re-vendored once (product's describe payload gains `minimum`).

## Rejected

- **A schema builder kept in the runtime crate**: the runtime would keep a protocol of string types
  for surface knowledge it does not need.
- **Defaults applied guest-side only**: works for SDK guests alone.
- **Omitting unset flags**: the CLI has always sent `false`; product's `--details` reads either way,
  but `is_set` would change on the command line.
- **A new diagnostic code for "not served"**: I017 is already MCP's "not served" report; an E-level
  code would make MCP's validate report errors `check` does not.
- **MCP's -32002 for unknown resources**: it touches every core resource; out of scope.

## What would reopen it

A third surface needing a derivation `ExtensionCommand` cannot give (it grows a method, not a copy),
or MCP adopting -32002 for unknown resources.
