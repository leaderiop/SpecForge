// Milestones — delivery phases
//
// Rewritten from scratch with clear priority ordering based on:
// 1. Entity dependency DAG — foundational entities before dependent ones
// 2. Compilation pipeline order — parse > resolve > graph > validate > export
// 3. Vision horizons — H1 (individual value) > H2 (ecosystem) > H3 (standard)
// 4. Each phase ships something usable — no setup-only phases
//
// Phase dependency DAG (enforced via depends_on fields):
// H1: P1 > P2 > P3 > P4 > P5, P4 > P6 > P7, P4 > P8
// H2: P8 > P9 > P10 > P11, P4 > P12 > P13, P11 > P14
// Planned: P10 > P15, P11 > P16, P11 > P17
