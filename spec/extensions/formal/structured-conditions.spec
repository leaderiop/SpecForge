// Moved from @specforge/software formal-contracts.spec per 10-expert panel.
// Terminology: "Design by Contract" -> "Structured Conditions"
// All behavior IDs renamed se_ -> fa_
//
// Conditions are inline blocks on behaviors that reference invariants.
// Inline:    requires { name "description" }
// Inline conditions produce ConditionEntry nodes in the AST.
