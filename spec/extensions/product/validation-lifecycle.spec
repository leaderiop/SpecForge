// Status Transition Validation (W087-W091)
//
// These rules validate status transitions by comparing the current
// status against the previous status stored in the build cache.
// The build cache is an explicit, opt-in artifact — NOT implicit
// compiler state. It is produced by `specforge check --cache` and
// stored as a deterministic JSON file (specforge-cache.json) in the
// project root. When no cache file exists (first build or
// cache-disabled workflows), transition rules are suppressed.
//
// This design preserves deterministic compilation: the same inputs
// (spec files + cache file) always produce the same outputs. The
// cache file is a declared input, not hidden state. CI pipelines
// that want transition validation commit the cache file; pipelines
// that want stateless builds simply omit it.
//
// Without cache: only enum validity is checked (W077-W085).
// With cache: transition validity is additionally checked (W087-W091).
