    Journey flow steps that contain bracketed entity references SHOULD

    Unresolvable references produce I090.

    Extraction regex: \[([a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]{1,59})\]

    (2-60 chars: starts with letter or underscore, then letters, digits,
    or underscores), and a closing bracket. The entity ID character set
    matches the spec-wide entity ID format.

    Edge cases:
    - Nested brackets "[[foo]]" — the outer pair is NOT matched; the
      inner "[foo]" IS matched as a valid reference.
    - Empty brackets "[]" — not matched (minimum 2 chars in capture).
    - Escaped brackets "\[foo\]" — not treated as references (the
      backslash prevents the opening bracket from starting a match).
    - Multiple references in one step "Use [auth] then [billing]" —
      each is extracted and validated independently.
    - Non-ID content "[hello world]" — not matched (spaces are not
      valid in entity IDs).
    - Markdown links "[text](url)" — "[text]" is extracted as a
      candidate reference. If "text" is not in the journey's features
      list, I090 fires. Authors should use backticks for code references
      that are not entity IDs: `[not_a_ref]`.
