    When specforge export is invoked with --max-tokens, the system MUST
    estimate the output token count before serialization. If the estimate
    exceeds the budget, the system MUST apply a truncation strategy:
    prioritize entities by graph centrality, truncate low-priority entities,
    and include a TokenBudgetResult in the output metadata. The strategy
    field names the approach used; the one strategy is `prioritize`. If no
    --max-tokens is specified, this behavior MUST be skipped.
    The TokenBudgetResult MUST list any truncated entity IDs so agents can
    request them individually via specforge query. When truncating entities
    from the budget, the system MUST remove all edges to and from truncated
    entities before serialization. The remaining subgraph MUST be a valid
    graph with no dangling edge references. The truncated_entities list in
    TokenBudgetResult records which entities were removed. Centrality is
    degree centrality (count of incoming + outgoing edges); neither the
    strategy nor the metric is configurable.

    The graph, context and brief exports are budgeted alike: each lists the
    entities it dropped under `token_budget`, keeps no entity when only its
    envelope and that block fit, and fails with E062 when even those, or an
    embedded schema (which is never cut short), are over the budget.
