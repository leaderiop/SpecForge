    In MCP server mode, the system MUST register a specforge.render tool that
    accepts format (required, a format string matching a registered renderer),
    out_dir? (output directory path) and scope? (an entity id). The tool MUST
    invoke the matching registered renderer and write output files to out_dir;
    without out_dir it MUST return the rendering inline instead. A relative
    out_dir names a directory under the call's project root, wherever the
    server runs; with no project served a relative out_dir MUST be refused as
    invalid input on out_dir. output_files lists the absolute paths written.
    The renderers are the core graph engine's export formats (see P7
    justification in features/output.spec), named as `specforge export
    --format` names them: graph (also accepted as json; the full graph, as
    `specforge export --format graph` writes it, in graph.json), dot,
    context and brief. The result's format is the renderer's name.
    Extension renderer contributions are not dispatched by this tool.
    Renderers produce graph diagnostic artifacts: JSON serializations, DOT
    visualizations, traceability matrices, validation summaries. They MUST NOT
    produce source code, application configuration, user documentation, or any
    artifact consumed by end users or deployed to production. The distinction:
    if the artifact helps understand the graph, it belongs here; if it is
    consumed beyond the spec workflow, it belongs to an agent (vision/README.md).
    Unrecognized format strings MUST return an error listing available renderers.
    The response MUST list all files written.
