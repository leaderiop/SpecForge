    records the version the extension itself declares (its handshake), with

    peer rule (ADR 0041) before anything is installed: a peer range that is
    not a SemVer requirement is refused with E073. A peer the lock pins at
    a version outside the new extension's range is a version diamond (ADR
    0001): from a registry the operation MUST be rejected with R-RES-006
    naming the version that would satisfy every requirer, or R-RES-005 when
    no published version does; a local install, with no registry to
    consult, MUST be rejected with E027. Installing a package at a version
    a locked extension's peer range does not accept MUST be rejected the
