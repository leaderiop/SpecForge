// ── Domain-Specific Validation ──────────────────────────────
// Domain-specific validations (unreferenced entity checks, unused reference
// warnings, unverified entity warnings, trigger consistency checks, etc.)
// are declared as ValidationRulePatterns in extension manifests and are
// defined in their owning extension directories:
//   - spec/extensions/software/validation-rules.spec
//   - spec/extensions/product/validation-rules.spec
//   - spec/extensions/governance/validation-rules.spec
// The core compiler executes these patterns generically via the declarative
// validation engine (see behaviors/zero-entity-core.spec).
// Diagnostic codes (W001, W003, W004, W007, E051, etc.) are defined by
// their owning extensions, not by the core compiler.

// ── Structural Validation (core — domain-agnostic) ───────────
// DiagnosticBag accumulator pattern: core structural validators do not emit
// individual diagnostic events. Instead, each validator appends Diagnostic
// values into a shared DiagnosticBag. After all structural validators have
// run, the bag is drained into the declarative_validation_executed aggregate
// and forwarded to validation_complete. This avoids O(n) event fan-out for
// large graphs and lets the pipeline batch diagnostics for deterministic
// ordering (see diagnostic_determinism invariant).
// Core structural validations operate on graph topology and field presence
// WITHOUT knowledge of entity semantics. They check: dangling references,
// duplicate IDs, import cycles, unreferenced structural nodes (W012 for any
// grammar-level structural kind — ref, spec — with zero incoming edges),
// and file-reference existence. Extension-defined entity kinds opt into
// generic unreferenced detection via extension-defined `no_incoming_edges`
// ValidationRulePatterns. Domain-specific unreferenced rules (e.g., W001 unreferenced
// entity) are extension-defined ValidationRulePatterns.
