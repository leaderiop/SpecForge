// Surface contribution behaviors — CLI commands, MCP tools, MCP resources
//
// Extensions declare surface contributions in their manifest's `surfaces`
// field. The registry build registers and checks them; the CLI and MCP
// dispatch to the cmd__{id} and mcp__{name} exports. What the host cannot
// check (export presence: a component guest routes every export through
// one call) and what nothing configures (a per-contribution toggle) are
// not specified (ADR 0011). On the guest side, an extension built with the
// SDK declares each surface with its handler: the SDK derives the
// `surfaces` payload and routes the exports from that one declaration, so
// the guest routes every export it declares (ADR 0011, Adjustments).

    When a CLI command from an extension is invoked, the host MUST
    serialize the command's input as JSON (CommandInput: its args, the
    project root, the compiled graph, the format asked for and the
    host's date, UTC) and call the cmd__{id} export,
    in the runtime that loaded the project's extensions to read their
    declarations: only the extensions the project enables are loaded,
    each compiled once per process (from the wasm compile cache when it
    is warm), and dispatching a command loads no module. The CLI routes
    specforge {ext_short} {command} to it, the command line built from
    the declared args and the host's --path, --help and --format (human,
    the default, or json; a command declaring an arg of one of those
    names is refused, exit 2); an auto-promoted MCP tool runs the same
    export with its arguments as the args, over the served graph, always
    asking for json: a JSON object the command prints on success (with
    nothing on stderr) is the tool result's structured content too, and
    a failure that prints one JSON object on stderr and nothing on stdout
    is an isError result carrying that object; any other output (an
    array, a scalar, prose) is text blocks, isError when the exit code
    is not zero. The extension renders both
    formats; the host knows no payload (ADR 0011). The export
    MUST be granted no capability: its WASI context preopens no
    directory and passes no environment, arguments, inherited stdio or
    network, so cwd is a path it is told, not one it can open, and the
    graph is all it reads. A per-command sandbox override (if declared)
    is not applied: with nothing granted there is nothing for it to
    withhold, and no override grants more (surface_sandbox_ceiling).
    Wasm traps MUST be caught and reported as ExtensionError
    diagnostics, as is a declared export the guest does not route (the
    host cannot list a component guest's exports, so presence is known
    only by calling). An answer that is not a CommandOutput is an
    ExtensionError (E028), like a trap: never exit 0 with the raw bytes.
    Under --format json the CLI writes the error to stderr as one error
    object of the shape commands write ({code, message, suggestion}),
    and exits 1. A
    usage error the command line catches before the command runs (a
    value outside a one_of, a missing required arg, an unknown flag, a
    value that is not an integer, or below the arg's minimum) is, under
    --format json (wherever it
    is on the command line), one INVALID_INPUT error object of that
    shape on stderr ({code, message, suggestion?}, the message naming
    the arg as declared and, for a one_of, its values), nothing on
    stdout, exit 2; under human it is clap's usage text, exit 2; --help
    is clap's, exit 0. The command's exit code, stdout, and stderr MUST be
    returned to the caller. The MCP server records each command whose
    export returned as a surface_command_dispatched event.
