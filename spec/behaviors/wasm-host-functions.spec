// Host function ABI contracts for Wasm extensions
//
// Design note: Host functions are synchronous RPC-style ABI calls within a
// single compilation step, not asynchronous pipeline stages. They do NOT
// produce events themselves — traceability comes from the calling behavior's
// events (e.g., extension_validated, contribution_exports_dispatched), not
// from the host function invocation. This is an intentional architectural
// decision: host functions are leaf operations in the call chain, not
// pipeline stages that trigger downstream consumers.
