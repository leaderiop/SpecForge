    All MCP tools, resources and prompts MUST return structured error objects

    free-form text. A failed tool call is an isError result whose content is
    an McpError; a diagnostic code behind the failure is in its diagnostic,
    not only in the message. A failed prompts/get or resources/read, which
    have no isError result, is a JSON-RPC error whose data is its McpError:
    -32602 when the client can fix it (an argument it named, invalid input,
    an unknown entity or extension, a conflict), -32603 otherwise. A resource
    that does not exist (no entry serves the URI, or the entity it names is
    not in the graph) is -32002 in a handshake session and -32602 in a
    2026-07-28 request, and its data names the URI as uri. A refusal for a
    missing project names the path argument only where the entry takes one.

    The project an MCP server serves is replaced whole or not at all, and

    the list methods) first brings it up to date with the files on disk
    (bring_session_up_to_date), unless the tool's use_cached says otherwise:
    an update for changed sources, an environment reload with its extension
    tools and resources for a changed specforge.json, specforge.lock or
    extension module. Subscribed clients learn what changed. A call whose
    path names another project acts on that project only, compiled for the
    call, and the server keeps serving its own without reloading it. A call
    that names a tool, a resource or a prompt looks it up in the project as
    it is on disk: an extension enabled since the last request is found by
    the next one, whether the request is a call, a read, a listing or a
    subscription (one freshness decision, owned by the request pipeline). A call
    whose path names a project while none is served serves that project.
    With no project served and none named, what a call gets is declared by
    the entry's target: an entry that reads only the project view (the read
    views, export and render, the navigation reads of the graph, every core
    prompt and resource) answers over the empty session, and one of its
    reads that names a file or an entity is the no-project refusal
    (precondition_failed), never not-found; an entry that acts on the
    project on disk (a tool that takes a path, a management tool, a read of
    the inference or anchors manifest, every extension tool and resource)
